# Bash Exercises – Command Line Crash Course

This repo contains my notes and learning from working through an open-access command line book. While the individual exercises weren’t committed due to being mostly run directly in the shell, this serves as a summary of the concepts covered.

## Topics Explored

- Basics of the Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Navigating files and directories
- Executing and managing files
- Environment variables and the `PATH`
- File and directory permissions (user, group, others)
- Understanding executables and shell behavior
- Getting comfortable with `chmod`, `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, and more

## Why I did this

I wanted to strengthen my foundation in the shell — to move from just copying commands to truly understanding them. This book provided a great, beginner-friendly yet thorough walkthrough of the Unix philosophy and practical terminal usage.
